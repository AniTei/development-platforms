## Market Comparison

One of the other tools that Bootstrap competes with is Tailwind, there are other frameworks out there but we will look at the pros and cons of these two.

### Bootstrap

#### Pros

- A wide range of pre-built components which speeds up development.
- Responsive Grid System which makes it easier to design layouts that work for different screen sizes.
- Great documentation with plenty of examples that makes it easier to get started.
- Large community to ask for help, get plugins and more.

#### Cons

- Can lead to similar looking websites if not customized because of the pre-designed components.
- File size can be larger than Tailwind which means slower load times.
- If you customize Bootstrap it may lead to overriding default styles and that might create conflicts.

### Tailwind

#### Pros

- Flexible and highly customizable.
- Smaller file sizes which improves performance.
- Utility-First Approach which mean you can style directly in HTML using pre-existing classes.
- Large community and support.

#### Cons

- Steeper learning curve.
- Limited pre-built components.
- Risk of inconsistent design

## Getting Started

To add bootstrap to yout project just follow this guide.

### Option 1: CDN Link

Ideal for prototyping or when you don't need to customize Bootstrap.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Option 2: install using npm

This method is best for when you want to customize Bootstrap.

You need to install node.js for this to work (link included in the "Additional Resources" section).

First create a package.json by using this command in your project directory:

```bash
npm init -y
```

After the package.json is created use this command to install Bootstrap:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```

Then import Bootstrap into your main JavaScript file:

```javascript
import "bootstrap";
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
```

If you want to read more on how to get started there are more links included in "Additional Resources".

## Conclusion

Bootstrap is great for beginners because of the great documentation with many examples and the pre-built components, it is also great for projects that needs to be developed fast. Tailwind is a better choice if the development team wants full control over the design and is willing to build a more custom UI, but the steeper learning curve makes it harder for beginners.
